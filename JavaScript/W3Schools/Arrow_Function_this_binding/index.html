  <h2>JavaScript "this"</h2>

  <p>This example demonstrate that in Arrow Functions, the "this" keyword represents the object that owns the function,
    no matter who calls the function.</p>

  <p>Click the button to execute the "hello" function again, and you will see that "this" still represents the window
    object.</p>

  <!--
    In regular functions the this keyword represented the object that called
    the function, which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever.

    With arrow functions the this keyword always represents the object that
    defined the arrow function.

  <button id="btn">Click Me!</button>

  <p id="demo"></p>

  <script>
    var hello;

    hello = () => {
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += this;
    }

    //The window object calls the function:
    window.addEventListener("load", hello);

    //A button object calls the function:
    document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", hello);
  </script>
